#+TITLE Notes
* Data structures
** Trees
*** BST
This one has been the hardest so far tbh. It took me way too long to actually be able to create my insert function.
It wasn't because the function was hard to write, that part took me about 10 minutes (still probably too long).
It was the fact I was using a templated BST class. And when I tried to write my own BST print function, the template stuff was breaking everything
I tried to overload the cout << operator, but that was a mistake.
I then tried to just make some print functions (which had to also be templated), but that also didn't work out.
I ended up just doing a non-templated BST class which made it easier. Probably don't really need templated class anyway
[[file:trees/bst.cpp::class BinarySearchTree {][Here's]] the current version of the class

Still need to create a [[file:trees/bst.cpp::~BinarySearchTree() {}][destructor]]
